The files supplement the manuscript "The ocean carbon sink saves billions for national climate policies and enhances inclusive wealth".

Supplementary Data_M1 includes the attribution of the ocean carbon sink to countries.
Supplementary Data_M2 includes the estimates for the country social cost of carbon and based on these the calculation of the contribution to comprehensive investment and inclusive wealth.
Supplementary Data_M3 includes the calibration of the CO2 abatement model, i.e. data from DART model and calibration of regional marginal abatement cost curves.
Supplementary Data_M4 includes the CO2 market model and the calculation of the CO2 prices and abatement cost for emissions reduction targets as defined by the national determined contributions (NDCs). The file includes the possibility to increase the abatement level in order to respond to a weakening of the ocean carbon sink. 

All files include a separate readme file.
